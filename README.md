# How can RFM analysis be used to identify customer churn patterns?
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. The goal is to identify key drivers of churn and guide future customer retention strategies.

# Key Takeaways:
#### Churn customers place fewer orders: Churn behavior seems more influenced by engagement freqeuncy rather than spending behavior. 
#### Shipping cost and time show no correlation with churn: reducing churn through shipping incentives are unlikely to yield strong results.
#### Discount strategies are ineffective at reducing churn: Current discount patterns are not well-targeted toward customers.

# Final Key Takeaway:
#### Churn behavior is not significantly influenced by spending behavior, shipping time, shipping costs, or discounts. Instead, churn appears more closely tied to customer engagement frequency and other behavior factors not captured in the dataset.
